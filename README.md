# Veins
Veins is not a network like Melisfon, G-Circle, Helping Hands and other referral networks. Veins is a smart auto-referral platform that can be used by members of referral networks.


If you’re already a member of an existing network, what Veins does for you is to enable other people to recruit themselves under you by default, making it unnecessary for you to chase prospects up and down to join your network – something every network marketer day dreams about.

If you’re still considering registering on a network but not sure which one, Veins can also help you choose by allowing you to sign up temporarily on one or more networks you’re considering so you can compare. 
The network that has more and more people signing up after you is probably the one you’ll like to register on – it’s one of the best benefits of Veins to people who’re thinking about network marketing.
   
After you sign up, the tool handles virtually every other process automatically from there. 

And, believe it or not, it’s 100% Free to use.

Just think about it for a moment; 

Try to imagine that you used Veins to sign up on one of the networks, say, Melisfon, at 8am today. 

And after work, you log in again by 4pm to check and, to your greatest amazement, you see that 150 persons more have signed up after you on the same network – all in less than 10 hours. 

Tell me, what further proof will you need to be convinced to register on that network asap? 
Absolutely none, and this is why: 
1. You've already seen that those 150 persons are interested in joining the same network and, 
2. Just like you, they too have noticed how quickly more and more people are showing interest to join the network by signing up. 

So what do you do? 

Everything you can to get registered on that network before someone who's signed up behind you does. 
That's because when you do, all the other 150 other people behind you (and many others signing up everyday) will end up registered under you on that network… and the result will be higher compensations for you as you’re pushed to higher earning levels in your network.

But...

What if I told you that’s not even the biggest benefit there is to using Veins? 

What if I told you that you don’t even have to pay your own registration fee to get registered on the network you choose?

One of the best things about being part of a group like this one is that group members get to be one of the first to benefit from using tools like this one before people outside even get to hear about it. 

So, since we’re not charging for it, I’ll reveal the secrets here. I've disclosed the 3 secrets in a document I saved here in my group. 

Just to clear any doubts; you’re not paying for using Veins or for joining my group or for the secrets, and I’m not going to sell you anything on my group. 

Why I set up this group in the first place is to be able to take your questions, comments, testimonials and suggestions so my team can keep improving the tool’s usability. 

So, like I said, I shared the secrets here in the document titled Secret Veins Sauce. You can go through it right after this one and get a hold of the three biggest secrets that make Veins an even more amazing tool that it is.
