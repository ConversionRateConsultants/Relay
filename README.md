Try to imagine that, by 8am today, you logged on to a platform and signed up on one of these referral networks, say, Melisfon.  

And after work, you log in again by 4pm to check and, to your greatest amazement, you see that 150 persons more have signed up after you on the same network – all in less than 10 hours.  

Then 15 minutes later, you receive a notification from the platform’s Admin that you’re next in line to register with Melisfon in 3 days time, and requesting that you send a message to accept or decline the registration.  

Tell me, what further proof will you need to be convinced to register on Melisfon asap?  
Absolutely none, and this is why:  

1. You've already seen that 150 persons, and growing, are interested in joining Melisfon, and that’s why they signed up, you were just fortunate to have signed up before they did.  

2. Just like you, they too have noticed how more and more people signing up to join Melisfon.  

So what do you do?  

Everything you can to get registered on Melisfon with the 3 days notice else someone who's signed up behind you takes your place on Melisfon.  

However, when you do register, all the other 150 other people behind you (and many others signing up everyday) will end up registered higher you on Melisfon… and within a week you’d have moved from Entry level to Level 3 on the network, earning over N120k within just a week.  

Imagine how enjoyable the rest of your journey through levels 4, 5 and 6 will be.  

But...  

What if I told you that’s not even the biggest benefit there is to using that platform?
